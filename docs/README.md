```go
func Boot(routes RouteCollection, port uint16)
```
Boot is a standard server CLI

Provide a set of routes to serve and a port to serve on.

Usage: executable [-r | --register-client client_name] [-c |
--check-registration token] [-u | --unsecured]

    -r | --register-client client_name

registers a client, generates a token

    -c | --check-registration token

checks if a token is valid and returns name of client

    -u | --unsecured

runs groot without the security layer

    without args

Currently uses a db of client names.

#### func  StartServer

```go
func StartServer(routes RouteCollection, port uint16)
```
StartServer starts a secured arbor server (Token required for access)

Provide a set of routes to serve and a port to serve on.

#### func  StartUnsecuredServer

```go
func StartUnsecuredServer(routes RouteCollection, port uint16)
```
StartUnsecuredServer starts an unsecured arbor server (Token required for
access)

Provide a set of routes to server and a port to serve on/

#### type Route

```go
type Route struct {
	Name        string           `json:"Name"`
	Method      string           `json:"Method"`
	Pattern     string           `json:"Pattern"`
	HandlerFunc http.HandlerFunc `json:"Handler"`
}
```

Route is a struct that defines a route for a microservice

Name: Name of the route.

Method: The type of request (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.).

Pattern: The exposed url pattern for clients to hit, allows for url encoded
variables to be specified with {VARIABLE}.

HandlerFunc: The function to handle the request, this basicically should just be
the proxy call, but it allows you to specify more specific things.

#### type RouteCollection

```go
type RouteCollection []Route
```

RouteCollection is a slice of routes that is used to represent a service (may
change name here)

Usage: The recomendation is to create a RouteCollection variable for all of you
services and for each service create a specific one then in a registration
function append all the service collections into the single master collection.
